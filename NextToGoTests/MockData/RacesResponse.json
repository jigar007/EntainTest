Has the pace to settle in the leading division. Best figures should see him run well. MAJOR SAAB (3) is a six-start maiden who finished fifth at his most recent outing over 2000m at this track. Worth including in this suitable contest. CHANDRAYAAN (1) is back after a break of five-and-a-half months. At the last run before the layoff she finished seventh over 1600m at Pune.
